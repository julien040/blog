###  What is it about ?

In december 2021, [dev.to](https://dev.to) and [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) organized a hackathon. The goal was to create a project using MongoDB Realms. I decided to create a website where you can save snippet that could be share between your devices. I called it **Lotir**.
I was tired of sending emails to myself to share snippets between my devices. I wanted to have a website where I can save my snippets and access them from any device. So I made [one](https://lotir.ml).

### What did I use ?

Tools I used to make this project:

 - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
 - [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
 - [MongoDB Realm](https://www.mongodb.com/realm)
 - [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
 - [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
 - [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
