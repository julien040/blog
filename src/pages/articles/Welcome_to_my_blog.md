## Hey ! ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is **Julien** and I'm a student in computer science. <br>
I'm actually surprise someone is reading this, but I'm glad you are here.

## Who am I ?

I'm a 19 years old student in computer science. I'm currently in my first year of a "licence" (equivalent to a bachelor's degree) in computer science. On my spare time, I'm working at a non-profit organization called [Pacifiscan](https://pacifiscan.org/), where I'm building an open source application to help people recycle their  waste.

## What is this blog about ?

This blog is about my journey in computer science, and my projects. <br>
I will try to write articles about what I'm learning, and what I'm doing. <br>
I will also try to write articles about my projects, and how I made them.

## How was this blog made ?

This blog is made with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a static site generator. <br>
